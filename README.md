This repository demonstrates a common error when using the $inc operator in MongoDB update queries.  The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation, using a string value instead of a number.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code.  This incorrect usage can lead to unexpected behavior and data corruption.  Ensure you always use numeric values with the $inc operator.
